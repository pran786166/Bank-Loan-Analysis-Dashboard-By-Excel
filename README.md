# Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard

Welcome to the Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard repository! This project leverages the powerful capabilities of Excel to develop detailed dashboards providing actionable insights into loan applications and performance.

## Project Highlights

### Bank Report Summary Dashboard
1. **Good Loans vs. Bad Loans**
   - Analyzed the quality of loans to differentiate between well-performing and underperforming loans.

2. **Loan Metrics**
   - Detailed breakdown of funded amounts, amounts received, interest rates, and Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratios using pivot tables and pivot charts.

3. **Interactive Slicers**
   - Utilized grade and purpose slicers to dynamically filter and analyze data for more targeted insights.

### Bank Report Overview Dashboard
1. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
   - Tracked essential metrics such as total applications, total funded amount, total amount received, average interest rate, and average DTI.

2. **Loan Application Analysis**
   - Examined total loan applications by month, state, and term to identify trends and regional performance.

3. **Employee Length Analysis**
   - Analyzed loan applications based on the length of employment of applicants.

These dashboards, created with pivot tables, pivot charts, and interactive slicers, provide a clear and comprehensive view of the bank's loan performance. This project has significantly enhanced my skills in data analysis and dashboard creation, demonstrating the power of Excel in financial analysis.
